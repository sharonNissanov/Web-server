# **Create a Web Server**

Creating a HTTP server that serves the HTML & CSS and sending the information from the frontend to the backend and persisting it-by saving all the data in the 'data.json' file. <br /> 
⚡️ HTML, CSS, Node JS ⚡️<br />
👍 This was developed in the target style of https://glitch.com.<br />
👍 After each time the user clicks "Give Now", the donated amount sent to the web server. <br />
👍 The amount donated and the time of each donation are saved in the 'data.json' file.

### Setup & Run
- Clone or download this repository https://github.com/sharonNissanov/Web-server 
- Run the app in the development mode: in cmd run ```node  server.js``` to serve the html file.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.<br />
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.<br />
Start donate money and see what you get in the data.json file.

Enjoy 😊
